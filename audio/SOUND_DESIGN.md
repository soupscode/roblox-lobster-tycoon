## 🎯 Audio Design Philosophy

The audio of Lobster Tycoon should feel:

- **Oceanic** — Underwater bubbles, waves, and coastal vibes throughout
- **Whimsical** — Lobsters are inherently funny; lean into playful absurdity
- **Progressive** — Audio complexity grows with player advancement

## ⚙️ IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (Roblox SoundService)

### Sound Setup Best Practices

```lua
-- Creating a sound properly
local sound = Instance.new("Sound")
sound.SoundId = "rbxassetid://123456789"
sound.Volume = 0.5
sound.RollOffMode = Enum.RollOffMode.Linear  -- For 3D sounds
sound.RollOffMinDistance = 10
sound.RollOffMaxDistance = 100
sound.Parent = workspace.SomePart  -- Parent to part for 3D audio
```

### Volume Mixing Recommendations

| Category | Base Volume | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Master** | 1.0 | Player-adjustable in settings |
| **Music** | 0.35-0.45 | Background, never overwhelming |
| **Ambience** | 0.25-0.35 | Subtle, blends into background |
| **UI SFX** | 0.5-0.6 | Clear but not piercing |
| **Game SFX** | 0.6-0.8 | Prominent, rewarding |
| **Event Stingers** | 0.7-0.9 | Attention-grabbing, momentary |

**Mixing Tips:**
- Always leave headroom (master never above 0.9)
- UI sounds should cut through music without competing
- Ambience fills gaps but never noticed consciously
- Test on laptop speakers AND headphones

### SoundGroup Organization

```lua
-- Create SoundGroups for volume control
local SoundService = game:GetService("SoundService")

local musicGroup = Instance.new("SoundGroup")
musicGroup.Name = "Music"
musicGroup.Volume = 0.4
musicGroup.Parent = SoundService

local sfxGroup = Instance.new("SoundGroup")
sfxGroup.Name = "SFX"
sfxGroup.Volume = 0.7
sfxGroup.Parent = SoundService

local ambienceGroup = Instance.new("SoundGroup")
ambienceGroup.Name = "Ambience"
ambienceGroup.Volume = 0.3
ambienceGroup.Parent = SoundService
```

### Spatial Audio for 3D Sounds

**Use 3D Audio For:**
- Tank bubbling (localized to each tank)
- Machinery/pumps (localized to equipment)
- Lobster movement/sounds (localized to lobsters)
- Environmental sounds (waves near shore, dock creaks)

**Keep 2D (Non-Spatial) For:**
- UI sounds (always consistent volume)
- Music (global)
- Achievement stingers
- Notification sounds

```lua
-- 3D Sound Example (attach to a Part)
local bubbleSound = Instance.new("Sound")
bubbleSound.SoundId = "rbxassetid://TANK_BUBBLE_ID"
bubbleSound.Looped = true
bubbleSound.Volume = 0.5
bubbleSound.RollOffMode = Enum.RollOffMode.Linear
bubbleSound.RollOffMinDistance = 5  -- Full volume within 5 studs
bubbleSound.RollOffMaxDistance = 50 -- Inaudible beyond 50 studs
bubbleSound.Parent = lobsterTank    -- Parent to the tank part
bubbleSound:Play()

-- 2D Sound Example (play globally)
local uiClick = Instance.new("Sound")
uiClick.SoundId = "rbxassetid://UI_CLICK_ID"
uiClick.Volume = 0.5
uiClick.Parent = game.SoundService  -- Parent to SoundService for 2D
uiClick:Play()
```

### Music Transition Suggestions

#### Crossfade System
```lua
local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")

function crossfadeMusic(fromSound, toSound, duration)
    duration = duration or 2
    
    toSound.Volume = 0
    toSound:Play()
    
    -- Fade out current
    local fadeOut = TweenService:Create(fromSound, TweenInfo.new(duration), {Volume = 0})
    
    -- Fade in new
    local fadeIn = TweenService:Create(toSound, TweenInfo.new(duration), {Volume = 0.4})
    
    fadeOut:Play()
    fadeIn:Play()
    
    fadeOut.Completed:Connect(function()
        fromSound:Stop()
    end)
end
```

#### Music State Machine
| From State | To State | Transition |
|------------|----------|------------|
| Idle → Shop | 1.5s crossfade | Smooth, player is browsing |
| Idle → Racing | Quick 0.5s cut | Sudden, exciting |
| Racing → Idle | 2s crossfade | Cool-down period |
| Idle → Uprising | 0.3s cut + alarm stinger | Jarring, intentional |
| Any → Secret Area | 3s crossfade with reverb tail | Mysterious transition |
| Any → Prestige | Cut to silence → fanfare → new idle | Dramatic pause |

#### Dynamic Music Layering (Advanced)
```lua
-- Layer additional instruments as player progresses
local baseDrums = workspace.Music.BaseDrums      -- Always plays
local melodyLayer = workspace.Music.Melody       -- Unlocks at level 10
local bassLayer = workspace.Music.Bass           -- Unlocks at level 25
local fullOrchestra = workspace.Music.Orchestra  -- Unlocks at prestige

-- Start all synced but with volumes at 0
baseDrums.Volume = 0.4
melodyLayer.Volume = 0  -- Fades in at level 10
bassLayer.Volume = 0    -- Fades in at level 25

-- All play simultaneously for sync
baseDrums:Play()
melodyLayer:Play()
bassLayer:Play()
```
