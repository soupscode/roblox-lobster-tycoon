## MAIN DESCRIPTION (Short Hook)

**Ever wondered what it's like to build a lobster empire? No? Well, TOO BAD—you're about to find out!**

Welcome to **LOBSTER TYCOON**, the only Roblox tycoon game where:
- ✨ Lobsters are the ONLY currency that matters
- 🎰 RNG can bless you with legendary crustaceans (or curse you with Basic Bob)
- 💼 You'll negotiate with the sassiest shopkeeper in gaming history
- 🔥 Everything might be on fire but you're still making money
- 🌊 Capitalism meets the ocean floor in the most chaotic way possible

**Build your lobster empire. Collect rare species. Achieve seafood dominance. Touch grass (optional).**

## EXTENDED DESCRIPTION (The Pitch)

### 🦞 WHAT IS LOBSTER TYCOON?

Lobster Tycoon is a tycoon simulation game where you build, manage, and expand the ultimate lobster-based business empire! Start from nothing, collect increasingly ridiculous lobster species, upgrade your facilities, and become the ULTIMATE Lobster Tycoon!

But this isn't your average tycoon game. Oh no. This is *different.* This is *unhinged.* This is lobsters.

---

### ⭐ KEY FEATURES

**🎲 18+ UNIQUE LOBSTER SPECIES**
From Basic Bob (aggressively average) to God Emperor Lobster the Eternal (rules with an iron claw), collect bizarre and hilarious lobster species with unique abilities! Each one has personality, lore, and questionable life choices!

**💰 BUILD YOUR EMPIRE**
Start with a basic shack and transform it into a sprawling lobster industrial complex! Upgrade buildings, automate production, and optimize your cash flow! Your FPS will hate you!

**🛒 CRUSTY CARL'S SHELL SHACK**
Meet the snarkiest shopkeeper in gaming! Crusty Carl has OPINIONS. He has SASS. He has three ex-wives. Buy lobsters, upgrade your tycoon, and get roasted by a crustacean merchant who's seen it all!

**🏆 45+ ACHIEVEMENTS**
From "Baby's First Lobster" to "Transcendence," unlock achievements that celebrate your successes, questionable decisions, and outright chaos! Some are helpful! Some are memes! All are valid!

**🎰 RNG-BASED COLLECTING**
Will you get a Legendary on your first try? Or will you get 47 Basic Bobs? That's the thrill of the hunt, baby! Embrace the gacha! (Responsibly. Please.)

**👥 MULTIPLAYER MADNESS**
Visit friends' tycoons! Trade lobsters! Engage in friendly competition! (Or not-so-friendly economic warfare!) Build a lobster community or go full villain mode!

**🎨 CUSTOMIZATION GALORE**
Decorate your tycoon with hundreds of items! Dress up your lobsters in tiny hats! Make them wear monocles! They'll hate it but they're contractually obligated to comply!

**📱 PLAY YOUR WAY**
Idle player? Active grinder? Chaos enjoyer? Lobster Tycoon supports all playstyles! AFK automation, active management, or just vibing with your crustacean friends—it's all valid!
