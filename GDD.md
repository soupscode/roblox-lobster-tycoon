# 🦞 LOBSTER TYCOON - Game Design Document

**Genre:** Tycoon/Simulation  
**Platform:** Roblox  
**Target Audience:** Ages 9-16 (and weird adults who love crustaceans)  
**Tagline:** *"From Fisherman to Lobster Overlord"*

---

## 🎮 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Lobster Tycoon** is a tycoon game where players build a lobster farming empire, starting with a single bucket and a dream. Catch lobsters, breed increasingly bizarre mutations, sell them to questionable buyers, and eventually unlock the dark truth: the lobsters are becoming sentient. Will you side with humanity or join the Crustacean Revolution?

## 🔄 CORE GAMEPLAY LOOP

### Phase 1: CATCH
- **Starting Equipment:** Rusty net, a bucket, crushing student debt
- Players click to catch wild lobsters from the ocean
- Early game: Manual clicking (carpal tunnel speedrun)
- Mid game: Unlock "Lobster Traps" (passive income)
- Late game: "Industrial Vacuum Boat" that just *s u c c s* lobsters from the sea

**Funny Twist:** Sometimes you catch trash (boots, old phones, expired coupons, a very confused crab who apologizes profusely)

### Phase 2: BREED
- Place lobsters in tanks to breed
- Breeding mechanics:
  - **Normal Breeding:** Red Lobster + Red Lobster = More Red Lobsters (boring but reliable)

**Breeding Cooldowns:**
- Common: 30 seconds
- Rare: 2 minutes
- Epic: 5 minutes
- Legendary: 15 minutes
- Cryptid: 1 hour (worth it)

### Phase 3: SELL
- Sell lobsters to various buyers:
  - **Local Restaurant:** Standard prices, reliable
  - **Fancy Hotel:** 2x price for rare+ lobsters
  - **Black Market:** 5x price but has a chance to "investigate" you
  - **Mad Scientist:** Buys mutants at insane prices, asks no questions
  - **Lobster Liberation Front:** Pays you to FREE lobsters (ironic capitalism)
  - **The Void:** Appears at midnight, buys anything, pays in "Void Credits" (special currency)

### Phase 4: UPGRADE
- Spend cash on:
  - Better tanks (capacity, breeding speed, decoration)
  - Automation (auto-catchers, breeding bots)
  - New areas (unlock new biomes with unique lobsters)
  - Research tree (genetic modifications, efficiency upgrades)
  - **Lobster Happiness Meter:** Happy lobsters breed faster (must add toys, music, tiny lobster gyms)

### Phase 5: REPEAT (but weirder)
- The loop accelerates
- Unlock increasingly absurd content
- The lobsters start... watching you...

## 🦞 CONCLUSION

**Lobster Tycoon** combines addictive tycoon gameplay with absurdist humor, creating a unique experience that's both relaxing and hilariously chaotic. The progression from humble fisherman to Lobster Overlord gives players a sense of accomplishment, while random events and mutations keep gameplay unpredictable.

The game's secret sauce is its tonal shift: start cute and silly, gradually introduce existential questions about lobster sentience, and culminate in players questioning if they're the villain. But hey, at least the lobsters are happy! (Are they?)

**Core Appeal:**
- Satisfying progression loops
- Collectible lobsters (gotta catch 'em all)
- Humor that appeals to kids AND adults
- Social features (trading, racing, showing off)
- Depth beyond typical tycoon games

**Why it works:**
- Lobsters are inherently funny
- Mix of casual and hardcore content
- Respectful monetization (no aggressive pay-to-win)
- Meme potential (Lobster Uprising will trend on TikTok)

---

## 🙏 FINAL NOTE

This game is dedicated to all the lobsters who sacrificed their lives for human dinner plates. In Lobster Tycoon, they get their revenge... and also their own gyms, racing tracks, and dimensional portals.

**May your claws be sharp and your mutations legendary.**
